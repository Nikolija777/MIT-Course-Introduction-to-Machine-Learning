Week 2 is all about studying the perceptron algorithm and some of its modifications.
Tasks:
1. Implement perceptron
2.Implement averaged perceptron
3.Implement evaluation strategies
4. Evaluating a classifier
5. Evaluating a learning algorithm with a fixed dataset (Cross-Validation)
6. Evaluating a learning algorithm using a data source
