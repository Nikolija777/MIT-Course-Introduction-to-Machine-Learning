# MIT-Course-Introduction-to-Machine-Learning

I am currently following an MIT course - Introduction to Machine Learning (https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/course/). It seems very interesting to me. I will post some of the solutions to the assignments, as well as my experiments :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

### Overview:

:round_pushpin: Week 1: Introduction
:round_pushpin: Week 2: Perceptron
:round_pushpin: Week 3: Features (linear regression)
:round_pushpin: Week 4: SVM, KNN and Logistic Regression

Also, I will post my graduation paper (in my school, every student has to choose a topic and write an article about it before graduating) - Introduction to Neural Networks (Mentor: Professor Petar Radovanovic). In the paper, I described the basics of neural networks - how they learn, the most common mistakes that occur in this process, methods of optimising and improving their performance. However, it is on Serbian language. So if you have any question, do not hesistate to contact me. :relaxed:
