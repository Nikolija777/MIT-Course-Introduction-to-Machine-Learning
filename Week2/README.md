Week 2 is all about studying the perceptron algorithm and some of its modifications.
Tasks:
* Implement perceptron
* Implement averaged perceptron
* Implement evaluation strategies
* Evaluating a classifier
* Evaluating a learning algorithm with a fixed dataset (Cross-Validation)
* Evaluating a learning algorithm using a data source
